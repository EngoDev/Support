text = "[center][font_size=18]Hi! nice to meet you, my name is Engo and I'm an aspiring game developer.
I wanted to try out Godot so I gave myself a challenge to learn it and make a silly little game as fast as possible and this is the game you (hopefully) just played. Overall it took me around 24 hours to finish it, I know it's not a lot and not very gamey but it was mostly a learning game and I'm pretty happy with the results (Although polishing is needed)

One of my favorite things in the whole world is listening to people and supporting them in anyway that I can so I tried to make a game centered around that, I hope that I managed to pass these feelings through my game to you [b]üòä[/b]

In my spare time I teach kids Software Development and Cyber Security as another passion of mine, if you need guidance/help with your game or software development in general no matter what is your skill level feel free to send me a message on twitter [url=https://twitter.com/EngoDev]@EngoDev[/url] I would love to help out :)

If you have any feedback on my game it's very appreciated, you can either post a comment on [url=https://engodev.itch.io/support]itch.io[/url] or send me a message on twitter [url=https://twitter.com/EngoDev]@EngoDev[/url]

And once again, thank you for playing my game, it truly means a lot to me [color=red][b]‚ù§Ô∏è[/b][/color]"
